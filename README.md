# teamfinder2.0-backend

This project is a continuation of my teamfinder app built using the MERN stack.

Teamfinder 2.0 adds TypeScript to the backend and will also have user authorization and authentication which will be required to make changes to the database (i.e. teams and users)

## teamfinder 1.0 (for comparision)
The original app is deployed [here] (https://teamfinder.netlify.app/)
